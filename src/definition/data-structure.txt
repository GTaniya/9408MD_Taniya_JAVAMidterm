How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: In memory, For arrays at compile time and at runtime for linked lists.Array is a collection of elements of similar data type. On the other hand, Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type, which are connected to each other using pointers.

What is a Queue?
Answer: The Queue interface present in the java.util package and extends the Collection interface is used to hold the elements about to be processed in FIFO(First In First Out) order

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO is First In First Out and It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last. LIFO is Last In First Out.  It is a method for handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last.
