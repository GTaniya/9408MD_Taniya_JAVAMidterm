***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching, and Sorting

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:

What is an Array?
Answer: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java. Therefore array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList. The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: In memory, For arrays at compile time and at runtime for linked lists.Array is a collection of elements of similar data type. On the other hand, Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type, which are connected to each other using pointers.

What is a Queue?
Answer: The Queue interface present in the java.util package and extends the Collection interface is used to hold the elements about to be processed in FIFO(First In First Out) order

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO is First In First Out and It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last. LIFO is Last In First Out.  It is a method for handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: Sequential search. Sequential search is a basic form of searching that checks if an element is present in a given list

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The worst-case to search an element is linear

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code whereas Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value. HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
Answer:  RDBMS use Array, Network data model use Graph, and Hierarchical data model useTrees

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: A HashMap store items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type. HashMap stores only object references. Hashmap is useful when we need efficient implementation of search, insert and delete operations.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which is not present in the array. The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a subclass of IndexOutOfBoundsException, and it implements the Serializable interface.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: Manually, Arrays.copyOf(), System.arraycopy(), and Object.clone()

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: BFS stands for Breadth First Search. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS stands for Depth First Search. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
Answer: Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure.
        Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved.
